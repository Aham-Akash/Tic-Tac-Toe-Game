## üß† Project Overview
The **Tic-Tac-Toe Game** allows **two players (X and O)** to take turns marking spaces on a **3√ó3 grid**.  
The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.  
If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## üéÆ Gameplay Rules
1. The board is a **3x3 grid**, represented using a 2D character array.
2. **Player X** starts first, followed by **Player O**.
3. Players enter the **row and column (0‚Äì2)** for their move.
4. If a position is already taken or invalid, the program prompts the player to try again.
5. The game ends when:
   - A player wins (three symbols in a line), or  
   - The board is full (draw).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Program Logic
1. **Initialize the board** with empty spaces.
2. **Display the grid** after each move.
3. **Accept player input** for row and column.
4. **Validate the move** to prevent overwriting or invalid positions.
5. **Check for winning conditions** after every move.
6. **Detect draw** when the board is full.
7. **Alternate players (X ‚Üî O)** after each valid turn.
